# I'm Sean

> I go by attamusc (`atə-məsk`) pretty much everywhere

I'm a Sr. Engineering Manager at [GitHub](https://github.com/github). Previously, I was an Engineering Manager at Adobe on the [Behance Network](https://www.behance.net) and [Adobe Portfolio](https://portfolio.adobe.com) team.

I spend a lot of my time thinking about how to build better interactions on the web.

When I'm not doing that, I'm spending time with my family, watching garbage TV, playing video games, or working on one of far too many abandoned side projects.
